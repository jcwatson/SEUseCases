The Systems Engineering Workflow Use Cases project originated as part of the SysML Roadmap effort within the OMG Systems Engineering Domain Special Interest Group (SE DSIG). 

The intent of capturing these use cases is to identify the capabilities and infrastructure required by Systems Engineering Roles to develop systems across the product lifecycle. The near term goal is to utilize these use cases to better understand where SysML may be used in the future to better support these needs. 



We have created an empty license.txt file for you. Well, actually, it says,
"<Replace this text with the license you've chosen for your project.>" We 
recommend you edit this and include text for license terms under which you're
making your code available. A good resource for open source licenses is the 
[Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/).

Be sure to update your project's profile with a short description and 
eye-catching graphic.

Finally, consider defining a timeline and work items on the "Current Work" tab 
to give interested developers a sense of your cadence and upcoming enhancements.
